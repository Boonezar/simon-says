Created in CS2410 Intro to GUIs, Spring 2016. 

Created with Eclipse IDE.

Ran today (1/26/2021) with Java version 1.8.0_112.

Compile and Run Steps (paths used on windows):
```
cd .\src
javac .\cs2410\assn7\components\ScorePanel.java
javac .\cs2410\assn7\components\ColorPanel.java
javac .\cs2410\assn7\game\MainGame.java
java cs2410.assn7.game.MainGame
```

I don't think all of the available settings were completed, but some are working.
